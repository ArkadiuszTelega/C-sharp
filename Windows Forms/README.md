# Tic - Tac - Toe

This folder contains the Tic-Tac-Toe game done during classes.

## Playing the game

The easiest way would be to make a pull request and copying the whole thing on your Visual Studio and then running it.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

Visual Studio Community or professional, just use whatever IDE you feel the most comfortable with. 

As the whole game is written in C# with polish text you might need a translator if you really need one, in case you don't understand the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe.
